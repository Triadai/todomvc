# Template â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

## Interesting Things:

* Application composition separate from application logic
* Highly modularized: JS, HTML, *and CSS* are all modularized
* Clean HTML templates
* OOCSS for visual state changes--zero direct style manipulation
* Fully internationalized
* Application code has no explicit dependencies on:
	* DOMReady - application lifecycle, even DOMReady is managed transparently.  Things that can happen before DOMReady, do.  Things that can't, don't.
	* DOM Query engine
	* DOM Event library
